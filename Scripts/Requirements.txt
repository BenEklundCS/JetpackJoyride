Goal:
✅ Create a game world with a floor. The world will scroll from right to left endlessly.
✅ Add a player character that falls when no input is held, but rises when the input is held.
✅ Add obstacles that move from right to left. Feel free to make more than one type of obstacle.
✅ Obstacles can be placed in the world using a script so the level can be truly endless.
✅ Obstacles should either be deleted or recycled when they leave the screen.
✅ The score increases with distance. The goal is to beat your previous score, so the high score should be displayed alongside the current score.
✅ Player should flash red when hit.
✅ Sounds (keep it simple, backing music, player hit sound, missile sound if I add them).
✅ Add Title Screen with Reset Score functionality.
✅ Missile launcher obstacle, starts spawning after a certain distance, missiles are easily dodgeable but do damage on hit.

Stretch goal:
✅ Save the high score between play sessions.
TODO: Jetpack Particle Effects - Particle effects are a fun way to add game juice. Mess around with some here, making explosions or sparks when things get destroyed!
